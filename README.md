## Description
P-Deck is an unofficial expansion deck for [Agricola](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola) that slots painlessly alongside the standard E/I/K decks - the look, iconography, and sizing match the real thing. After 16 years of brainstorming half-serious, half-ridiculous gameplay ideas, we've implemented the most entertaining (yet balanced!) and compiled them in P-Deck.

## Features
- **42 New Occupations**
- **36 New Minor Improvements (Base Game)**
- **9 New Minor Improvements (Farmers of the Moor)**
- **Fully Modular** - shuffle the whole P-Deck into the standard E/I/K decks, use the P-Deck only, or draft your favorite cards into the standard E/I/K decks
- **Thoroughly Play-Tested** - we logged win-rates, pick-rates, and player feedback through five card revisions to ensure nothing was overpowered or useless 
- **Print-Ready PDFs** - 300dpi CMYK, 3mm bleed sheets, ready for printing by any on-demand service

## Examples of New Gameplay Mechanics
- **Loans & Debts** – Grab resources now with *IOU* or postpone renovation costs via *Under Construction*

- **Resource Swaps** – *Beggars Can Be Choosers* converts a single pickup into any other building resource, *Trader* performs 3‑for‑X swaps on demand

- **Livestock Shenanigans** – *Crossbreeder* allows you to mix species, *Petting Zoo* and *Puppy Mill* turn rooms and animals into weird breeding grounds

- **Layout Manipulation** – *Wallh4x* turns house walls into fences

- **Turn‑Order Manipulation** – Snipe the first pick with *Low Ping Bastard*, or flip the whole game with *Mirror Universe*

- **Family‑Growth Variants** – *Bad Parent* houses a child in a stable, *Child Labour* lets newborns work immediately

- **Offensive Actions** – Inflict tolls through *The Rent is Too Damn High*, or snipe animals off wood spaces using *Sniper Rifle*

- **Scoring Manipulation** – *Close Enough* rounds you up to 4 VP when you’re a single resource short, *Betting the Farm* awards 4 VP for hoarding ten grain (or penalties if you whiff), while *Gotta Catch ’Em All* increases the zero‑animal penalty for everyone
